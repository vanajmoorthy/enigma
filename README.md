# Enigma
### Okay it has been a looong night.

I watched a YoutTube video by CodeBullet.

_"Hey! Enigma! Didn't I watch a movie on that and read about it when I thought I was cool and liked cryptography for a week?"_

Okay, every kid has been intrigued by Nazis and Bletchley Park and Alan Turing and Enigma.

But has every kid been fortunate enough to stumble upon this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D2bJWHvqJo) while also having a rudimentary understanding of programming and knowing processing/p5?

Yeah probably.

But I did too.

So I though, "Hey, this doesn't seem too hard. Let me try this."

Now I love CodeBullet. But he doesn't show his code. "This'll be a fun challenge, right?"

**Wrong.**

This'll be a difficult challenge.
 
By the time I realised CodeBullet's Java/Processing code was on GitHub, I was already halfway down my shitty approach.

That basically resulted in some truly awful code.

But hey, it works.

Don't blame on my spaghetti code and my _amazing_ variable names. I wrote this at 6 am. 

So with a solid 6 hours down the drain a week before my exams.

I present to you

## Enigma

I'm not going to redo the UI, this was just a placeholder so I could see my work but I can't be bothered.

Okay I might redo it later.

Bye.
